              Security & Loss Prevention department within Amazon primarily deals with
              physical security (emphasis on internal affairs). The interesting aspect
              for me was that it practically means that the department wasn't technical
              in its nature.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was leading a new team within EMEA (later global) Security & Loss Prevention
              department working on an internal application from scratch (+ provided support
              for some existing apps my team got ownership of).
            </p>

            <p>
              Was specifically hired to a new team to implement a new project (knowledge management system)
              for the security specialists. Designed (techical side of things) the whole system.
              The challenge was the absence of any similarities in experience within the team and having to
              adapt to Amazon's ways of working e.g. had to do some budgeting and use AWS for everything.
            </p>

            <p>
              We delivered the MVP and the department was actively introducing it into their workflow
              (primarily, for trainings, overview articles, and index pages).
            </p>

            <p>
              Also had some fun trainings related to Security and Loss Prevention.

              (e.g. large business centres).
            </p>

            <p>
              Initially, I was approached by an ex-colleague (a senior manager within the company)
              asking for advice on a problem they had. He liked my suggestion so much he asked me
              to join their internal call so I could answer any follow-up questions.
              A few days later they asked me if I'm available to work on it as an independent contractor.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project was a map with frequently updated locations of several objects (buildings, vehicles,
              maintenance teams). The problem they were having is the choice of technology and the lack of
              any experience with similar projects. What I suggested is the company should collaborate
              with a sibling (Sberbank-owned) company that specialises in map GIS (the company is called
              <a target="_blank" href="https://info.2gis.com">2GIS</a>)
            </p>

            <p>
              My past experience working with map tech back in PROF-IT helped quite a lot as I was already
              familiar with some under the hood stuff map software.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project was a success and is still being used by the company.

              Initially, joined the "Used/Leasing" team. At the time that part of the business was
              new and full of potential so it involved a lot of product work and cross-functional
              collaboration. Some highlights of the experience: lots of AB-testing, cross-team
              collaboration (data analysts, designers, user researchers), Elm programming language,
              large team with well-oiled Kanban-based process.
            </p>

            <p>
              Later transitioned to the data team responsible for sinking and transforming large amounts
              of data coming from 3rd party vendors (hundreds GBs a night). The reason was primarily
              due to the team leader leaving and me being the only person outside the team who knew
              Clojure (and was interested in it). Apart from getting a chance to work with Clojure
              professionally, I was exposed to Kafka and working in a much smaller and chaotic team.

              Initially, worked on the authorisation system (roles and permissions)

            <p>
              However, shortly after was transitioned to the internal initiative to build
              a customer-facing helpdesk system to replace Zendesk. The initiative was
              around for a while but multiple developers have given up on it. Built and
              delivered it mostly from scratch (reused as much of the old prototypes as
              possible). The project was a success and the support team (along with
              the customers) were fully migrated to the new app giving the company
              full control over it (e.g. we introduced a reward system for the support
              team) and saving money long-term since they didn't have to pay for
              Zendesk anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
              My next project was a prototype for a system that established vendor-reseller
              relationship between different stores within the problem. I delivered the MVP
              just before I left the company to move to the UK.

              Lahouse was a small russian consultancy working with some big names (including L'Oreal)
              developing software for them in Ruby on Rails. Another side of the business was a project
              called ODIN - a platform for commercial real estate management.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was mainly involved in development of a legacy logistics app for L'Oreal as well as
              ODIN project. My responsibilities also involved mentoring an intern and maintenance of
              some other systems. I also had to deploy a helpdesk system <a target="_blank" href="https://helpy.io">Helpy</a>
              for L'Oreal which involved some system administration (Digital Ocean VPS)
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the notable improvements I introduced was splitting of ODIN project features into
              <a target="_blank" href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Rails engines</a>
              which unified different instances of ODIN across customers (each customer had their own
              customised version of ODIN living in a separate git branch) and enabled the business
              to sell separate features.

              I was looking to change jobs as I was interested in Object-Oriented Programming
              and was looking to work with Java. However, the interviewers were impressed
              with my Python script and decided to hire me as a Ruby developer. My mentor
